			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a data science professional with 4+ years of experience in the industry. I hold a Masters degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from IIT Bombay.

				Currently, I am working with L&T Financial Services in the Advanced Analytics team where my role involves developing data science solutions for various business problems such as Acquisition Scorecard, Collection Prioritisation, Trend Prediction, Segmentation, Optimization and Allocation.
				At L&T Financial Services, I have worked on several projects that involved developing predictive models using various techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting and neural networks.

				One of the most interesting projects that I worked on was developing a machine learning model to predict the credit risk of borrowers for the company's loan portfolio. This involved analyzing large volumes of data and identifying key variables that could impact credit risk. We then developed a model that could accurately predict credit risk and assign a score to each borrower.
				
				In addition, I have also worked on a project to optimize the allocation of resources for the company's sales and marketing teams. This involved developing a mathematical optimization model to determine the optimal allocation of sales and marketing resources across different geographies and channels.
				
				At IDFC First Bank, I worked on the Hyper Personalization Engine project where we developed machine learning models for targeted marketing communication across channels such as email, SMS, and social media. This involved analyzing customer data and developing models to predict the likelihood of customers responding to marketing campaigns.
				
				Overall, I have gained valuable experience in developing and deploying machine learning models for a variety of business problems. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to new and exciting projects.</p>
